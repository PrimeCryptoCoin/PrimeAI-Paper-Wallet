# üîê PrimeAI Paper Wallet

A paper wallet is a physical document containing your private and public keys. It is considered one of the most secure ways to hold PrimeAI because it keeps your keys completely offline and safe from online hacking attempts. 

Follow these steps to create your PrimeAI paper wallet:

1. Download the `primeai-paper-wallet.html` file

2. For extra security, ensure you are offline before generating your wallet. Disconnect your computer from the internet to protect against any online threats.

3. Run the `primeai-paper-wallet.html` file locally on your computer.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions and move your cursor randomly or type jibberish into the box to generate your new paper wallet.

5. Once your wallet has been created, print it out immediately.

6. Verify that the printed document contains your public and private keys in raw and QR code format.

7. Store the printed paper wallet in a safe and secure location, like a safe or a safety deposit box. Treat it as you would cash or other valuables.

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember, if you lose your paper wallet or if it gets damaged to the point that the keys are not legible, you will lose access to your PrimeAI. There is no way to recover your funds without your keys, so keep them secure and consider making backups.

For additional security, it is recommended to laminate your paper wallet to protect against physical damage and use a secure container for storage.

Your PrimeAI paper wallet is now ready to receive funds! To send or check your balance, you will use the public key (visible on the paper wallet). Always keep your private key confidential, as anyone with access to it can control your PrimeAI funds.

The "load and verify" wallet address refers to the public address of your PrimeAI wallet. This is the address you share with others to receive PrimeAI coins. It's akin to an email address that you'd give out to receive messages. However, anyone can also use this address to check the balance of the wallet on the blockchain because it's part of the public ledger.

The private key, on the other hand, is like a password. It is a secret key that is used to access and send your coins from the wallet address. Anyone with access to your private key can control the PrimeAI funds associated with your public address. Therefore, it should be kept secure and never shared with anyone.

# Adding your public address as a "Watch Wallet" to primeai-qt:
To add a wallet address as a watch-only wallet in the primeai-qt wallet software, you essentially add it to your wallet interface to keep an eye on its balance and transactions without having the ability to spend any of the coins (since you arent exposing the private key).

1. Open your primeai-qt wallet software.
2. Navigate to the 'File' menu and select 'Open URI' or similar option.
3. Enter the public wallet address that you wish to watch.
4. Confirm the addition, and the software will add the address onto your wallet interface.

Now, the primeai-qt interface will show the balance of the watched wallet, but remember, without the corresponding private key, you cannot send transactions from this wallet.

Always remember that if you are importing the wallet as a watch wallet, you are not "loading" the full wallet, just monitoring it, since the private keys are not inputted into the software.

# Procedure for Importing a Paper Wallet **private key** into the QT Wallet:

1) Perform a clean installation on a system without any previous wallet (ensure the absence of the .primeai directory). Prior to deletion, safeguard your seed words.

2) Run ./primeaid in one terminal window.

3) In another terminal window, execute ./primeai-cli importprivkey "MY-PRIVATE-KEY-GENERATED-ON-PAPER-WALLET".

4) Close the ./primeaid window (CTRL-C).

5) Open the QT wallet, set a passphrase, allow it to synchronize for a few minutes, and start enjoying your wallet.

END USER NOTES:

 1) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.

 2) Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 3) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.

 4) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.

 5) BIP38 most likely will not work on mobile devices due to hardware limitations.
